# HowToRunScenic

This repo is to help the Google Cloud Users to run one awesome JAX-based computer vision research repo, i.e. [Scenic](https://github.com/google-research/scenic)

## Prepare the code

We need some small modifications to make Scenic more friendly to the Google Cloud Users. The Scenic repo always uses the default dataset dir. However, for Google Cloud Users or other GPU users, the dataset location may be different. For instance, the Google Cloud Users usually store their dataset on Google Cloud Storage Budget. Therefore, we should edit the dataset loading function in Scenic. We use MNIST and ImageNet as examples here.

Before all, please fork the Scenic repo. And the you can edit your forked scenic repo.

### Prepare MNIST code

Frist, edit the get_dataset() function in [dataset_lib/mnist_dataset.py](https://github.com/google-research/scenic/blob/main/scenic/dataset_lib/mnist_dataset.py)

1.  remove this line of code (sometimes we do not need this since Scenic only have this line of code for a part of XXX_dataset.py):
```
del dataset_configs
```

2. pass dataset_configs.data_dir to dataset_builder:
```
  train_ds, train_ds_info = dataset_utils.load_split_from_tfds(
      'mnist',
      batch_size,
      split='train',
      data_dir=dataset_configs.data_dir, # Added by us.
      preprocess_example=preprocess_ex,
      shuffle_seed=shuffle_seed
)
```

3. do similar thing for eval_ds:

```
  eval_ds, _ = dataset_utils.load_split_from_tfds(
      'mnist', eval_batch_size,
      split='test', 
      data_dir=dataset_configs.data_dir,
      preprocess_example=preprocess_ex)
)
```

4.  add data_dir in config file, we assume we want to use [scenic/projects/baselines/configs/mnist/mnist_config.py](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/scenic/blob/main/scenic/projects/baselines/configs/mnist/mnist_config.py) for later training:

```
  # Dataset.
  config.dataset_name = 'mnist'
  config.dataset_configs = ml_collections.ConfigDict()
  config.dataset_configs.data_dir = 'YOUR_DATA_DIR'  # Added by us.
  config.data_dtype_str = 'float32'
```

The code for MNIST is ready now.

### Prepare ImageNet code

Similarly, we edit the get_dataset() function in [dataset_lib/imagenet_dataset.py](https://github.com/google-research/scenic/blob/main/scenic/dataset_lib/imagenet_dataset.py) to pass the data_dir into dataset_builder.

1. pass dataset_configs.data_dir to imagenet_load_split for train_ds:

```
  train_ds = imagenet_load_split(
      batch_size,
      train=True,
      onehot_labels=onehot_labels,
      dtype=dtype,
      shuffle_seed=shuffle_seed,
      data_augmentations=data_augmentations,
      data_dir=dataset_configs.data_dir  # added by us.
      )
```

2. pass dataset_configs.data_dir to imagenet_load_split for eval_ds:

```
  eval_ds = imagenet_load_split(eval_batch_size, train=False,
                                onehot_labels=onehot_labels,
                                dtype=dtype,
                                data_dir=dataset_configs.data_dir  # added by us
                                )
      )
```

3. edit imagenet_load_split function in [dataset_lib/imagenet_dataset.py](https://github.com/google-research/scenic/blob/main/scenic/dataset_lib/imagenet_dataset.py) to support data_dir arg:

```
def imagenet_load_split(batch_size,
                        train,
                        onehot_labels,
                        dtype=tf.float32,
                        image_size=IMAGE_SIZE,
                        prefetch_buffer_size=10,
                        shuffle_seed=None,
                        data_augmentations=None,
                        data_dir=None # added by us.
                        ):
```

4. edit the code inside of imagenet_load_split func:

```
# replace dataset_builder = tfds.builder('imagenet2012:5.*.*') by:
dataset_builder = tfds.builder('imagenet2012:5.*.*', data_dir=data_dir)
```

5. edit the config file, i.e. [projects/baselines/configs/imagenet/imagenet_vit_config.py](https://github.com/google-research/scenic/blob/main/scenic/projects/baselines/configs/imagenet/imagenet_vit_config.py)

```
  config.dataset_configs = ml_collections.ConfigDict()
  config.dataset_configs.data_dir = 'gs://YOUR_BUDGET_NAME/imagenet' # added by us.
```

Okay, the code is ready for both MNIST and ImageNet now. If you want to try other different datasets, you can just follow these two examples. The core is to pass data_dir to tfds.builder manually.

## Setup the environment.

Note that all the commands in this document should be run in the commandline of
the TPU VM instance unless otherwise stated.

Please make sure you set your gcloud configs first:

1. [Create](https://console.cloud.google.com/) a GCP project.

2. [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) `gcloud`.

3. Associate your Google Account (Gmail account) with your GCP project by
   running:

   ```bash
   export GCP_PROJECT=<GCP PROJECT ID>
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud auth application-default login
   gcloud config set project $GCP_PROJECT
   ```

4. Create a staging bucket if you do not already have one. We use europe-west4-a as an example:

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET_NAME=<GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET_NAME>
   export ZONE=europe-west4-a
   gsutil mb -l $ZONE gs://$GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET_NAME
   ```

Then, setup the TPU VM:

1.  Create a
    [Cloud TPU VM instance](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-cloud-tpu-vms)
    following
    [this instruction](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/jax-quickstart-tpu-vm#create-vm).
    We recommend that you develop your workflow in a single v3-8 TPU (i.e.,
    `--accelerator-type=v3-8`) and scale up to pod slices once the pipeline is
    ready. In this README, we focus on using a single v3-8 TPU. See
    [here](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/system-architecture-tpu-vm) to
    learn more about TPU architectures.

2.  With Cloud TPU VMs, you ssh directly into the host machine of the TPU VM.
    You can install packages, run your code run, etc. in the host machine. Once
    the TPU instance is created, ssh into it with

    ```sh
    export TPU_NAME=v3-8
    gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm ssh ${TPU_NAME} --zone=${ZONE}
    ```

    where `TPU_NAME` and `ZONE` are the name and the zone used above.


## Run your code on the TPU VM (for MNIST):

1.  Install the dependencies, one great way is installing t5x first. Most environment used in Scenic would be covered by that.

    ```sh
    git clone --branch=main https://github.com/google-research/t5x
    cd t5x

    python3 -m pip install -e '.[tpu]' -f \
      https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/libtpu_releases.html

    ```

2. Install Scenic and Run

    ```sh
    git clone --branch=main https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/scenic.git
    cd scenic
    pip install .

    export WORK_DIR=gs://${GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET_NAME}/scenic/mnist
    python3 scenic/main.py \
      --config=scenic/projects/baselines/configs/mnist/mnist_config.py \
      --workdir=$WORK_DIR

    ```
## Run on multi-host TPU VMs (for ImageNet):

Sometimes, we may conduct larger scale experiments with more TPU chips (e.g. v3-128) for larger datasets like ImageNet. In this case, we can run the code in this way:

 1. Combine the code in Section ``Run your code on the TPU VM`` into a single file run_scenic.sh. We provide an example in this repo.

 2. Run

    ```sh
    export TPU_NAME=v3-128
    gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm scp run_scenic.sh $TPU_NAME: --worker=all --zone=$ZONE
    gcloud alpha compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $TPU_NAME --zone=$ZONE --worker=all --command "bash run_scenic.sh"
    ```

Thank you for your interest on Scenic. Also thank [Fuzhao Xue](https://github.com/XueFuzhao)'s contribution on this document. If you found any issue when running Scenic on your own cluster, especially on Google Cloud Platform, please feel free to post an issue on this repo (preferred) or ping [Fuzhao XUE](https://github.com/XueFuzhao) via email. He would be happy to help.
