    This function is written to be used for 'fine-tuning' experiments. Here, we
    do some surgery to support larger resolutions (longer sequence length) in
    the transformer block, with respect to the learned pos-embeddings.

    Args:
      train_state: A raw TrainState for the model.
      restored_train_state: A TrainState that is loaded with parameters/state of
        a  pretrained model.
      restored_model_cfg: Configuration of the model from which the
        restored_train_state come from. Usually used for some asserts.

    Returns:
      Updated train_state.
