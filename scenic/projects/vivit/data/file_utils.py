"""Utility functions for working with sharded files.

A sharded file is a single conceptual file that is broken into a collection
of files to make parallelization easier.  A sharded file spec is like a
filename for a sharded file; the file spec "/some/path/prefix@200.txt"
says that the sharded file consists of 200 actual files that have names like
"/some/path/prefix-00000-of-00200.txt", "/some/path/prefix-00001-of-00200.txt",
etc.  This module contains functions for parsing, generating and detecting
sharded file specs.
