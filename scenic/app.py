"""Generic entry point for Python application in Scenic.

This provides run() which performs some initialization and then calls the
provided main with a JAX PRNGKey, the ConfigDict, the working directory
and a CLU MetricWriter.
We expect each scenic project to have its own main.py. It's very short but
makes it easier to maintain scenic as the number of projects grows.

Usage in your main.py:
  from scenic import app

  def main(rng: jnp.ndarray,
           config: ml_collections.ConfigDict,
           workdir: str,
           writer: metric_writers.MetricWriter):
    # Call the library that trains your model.

  if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(main)
